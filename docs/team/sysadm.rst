Lino system administrator
=========================

A **Lino system administrator** is the person who installs Lino
applications in order to make them available on a web server.  Your
job is to take care of the maintenance and security of those servers.

Typical requirements for a Lino system administrator are:

- Previous experience with managing Internet servers using `Apache
  <https://httpd.apache.org/>`_

- Lino is written in Python. You don't need profound knowledge of the
  language, but you are going to install Python packages (using `pip
  <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ into virtual environment (using
  `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html>`__).

- If you have previously hosted `Django
  <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ applications, then you will feel
  at home.
