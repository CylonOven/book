Limitations
===========

Lino is not for you, if...

- you just want a cheap, quick and dirty website with dynamic content
- you don't want to spend your time into developing a new software
- you want a cool website featuring the latest web technologies
- you don't plan to maintain your application

Note also that...

- Lino does not even *try* to be very easy to learn. It is a tool for
  experienced professional Python developers. There are other
  frameworks who can deliver quick visible results. With Lino it may
  take a day or two before you fall in love with it, but there is
  reason to hope that your love will last longer.

- Lino is not as well documented as Django or PHP. This is a
  disadvantage of using a young framework with a small community. But
  Lino is growing, and we are working on it.  Our goal is that every
  (motivated) beginner experiences joy when walking through the
  :ref:`lino.dev`. Give it a try, send your feedback, tell us where
  you got stuck, help us to make it easier for others to get started
  with Lino.

- Lino has no "visual GUI editor" because one of it's powerful
  features are :ref:`layouts` whose purpose is to describe user
  interfaces programmatically in the Python language.  We don't
  believe that a visual GUI editor is a good thing when it comes to
  maintaining complex database applications in a sustainable way. Rob
  Galanakis explains a similar opinion in `GeoCities and the Qt
  Designer
  <http://www.robg3d.com/2014/08/geocities-and-the-qt-designer/>`_

- Lino has no package manager because we have pip and git. Note also
  :ticket:`1053`.
