Limitations
===========

Lino is not for you, if...

- you just want a cheap, quick and dirty website with dynamic content
- you don't want to spend your time into developing a new software
- you want a cool website featuring the latest web technologies
- you don't plan to maintain your application

Note also that you need an experienced Python developer for creating
new Lino applications. Lino as a framework :doc:`does not even try
<not_easy>` to be easy to learn. This is a design choice, not a
limitation. Yes, such people tend to be expensive these days (Python
was second after Java in 2016, according to `Highest Paying
Programming Languages In 2016
