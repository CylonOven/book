Lino is not easy to learn
=========================

Lino is a tool for experienced professional Python developers.  It
does not even *try* to be easy to learn.  This is a design choice.
There are other frameworks who can deliver quick visible results.

Note that we don't speak about *using* Lino applications. *Using* a
Lino application is easy and intuitive. Or at least it should be (this
depends on the competence of the developers and their communication
with the users).

Note also that we don't speak about *writing* a Lino applications
(which is actually easy once you learned it).  We just speak about
*learning to write* new Lino applications.

Lino is a big beast to tackle because it has (comparend to plain
Django or similar frameworks) rather high-level UI concepts: tables,
forms, slave tables, menus, actions, virtual fields...

For a **stakeholder** this means that you need an experienced Python
developer for creating new Lino applications. 

For a **developer** this means that it may take a day or two before
you fall in love with Lino.  Lino requires you to :doc:`think in
Python <think_python>`.  But we hope that your love will last longer.

We admit that Lino is not yet well documented. This is a disadvantage
of using a young framework with a small community. But our community
is growing and we are working on it.  Our goal is that every motivated
beginner experiences joy when walking through the :ref:`lino.dev`.
Give it a try, send your feedback, tell us where you got stuck, help
us to make it easier for others to get started with Lino!
