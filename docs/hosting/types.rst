    A **master machine** is a virtual machine which hosts one or several
    demo sites on different Lino versions.

    customized for you by a
    developer

    You can set up and maintain a docker server and serve one of the
    dockerfiles maintained by the Lino team.  See e.g.
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/

    With Docker hosting the customer is always in stable mode and cannot
    switch to development mode.

    The Lino team plans to start this type of hosting as soon as there is
    a first pilot user.
