Community
=========

Lino is a young framework with a small but growing community.  The
work of building up and keeping alive this community is currently
being done by `Rumma & Ko <http://www.saffre-rumma.net>`_ a small
Estonian company whose CEO is Luc Saffre, the author and maintainer of
Lino. Here is their statement about community:

    We are doing our best to help the Lino community to grow, but we
    have no plans of becoming big ourselves.  If the Lino community
    would get bigger than we can manage, we recommend that it should
    be governed by a decentralized organization which does not have
    any private motivation on its own.  In order to open the door for
    this evolution, we created an organization on GitHub called the
    `Lino Core Team <https://github.com/lino-framework>`__ which owns
    the different repositories that make up the Lino Framework.
