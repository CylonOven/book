Lino is a young framework with a small but growing community.  Lino
wants humans.  Here are some profiles of people we would happily
welcome.

- **Software developers** -- Consider whether Lino is the right tool
  for one of your projects. See :doc:`developers`.

- **System administrators** -- consider installing a Lino application
  for your employer. See :doc:`admins`.
  
- **Internet hosting providers** -- Consider becoming a :doc:`hosting
  provider <hosters>` and contact us to get listed in our
  directory. Help us to develop
  a Lino application for managing Lino applications on a hosting server
  (:ticket:`1053`).

- **Friends** --
  Follow what's going on and give us your feedback. 
  Tell other people about Lino.
  Show the :ref:`demos` to other users of your
  employer and analyze whether they need a Lino application.  Your
  advantage is that you get free consultation for planning your
  project or with becoming a professional `Lino Consultant
  <http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/consultant>`_.

Who is behind Lino?
===================

The work of powering the Lino community is currently being done by
`Rumma & Ko <http://www.saffre-rumma.net>`_ a small Estonian company
whose CEO is Luc Saffre, the author and maintainer of Lino. Here is
their statement about community:

We are doing our best to help the Lino community becoming a big one,
but we have no plans of becoming *ourselves* big .  If the Lino
community would get bigger than we can manage, we recommend that it
should be governed by an independent organization which does not have
any private motivation on its own.  In order to open the door for this
evolution, we created the :doc:`Lino Team <team>`.
