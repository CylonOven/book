Lino is a young framework with a small but growing community.  Lino
wants humans.  Here are some profiles of people we would happily
welcome.

Individuals:

- **Anybody** -- consider learning one or several Lino applications in
  order to work as a :doc:`Lino trainer </team/trainer>` or :doc:`Lino
  analyst </team/analyst>`.

- **System administrators** -- consider installing a Lino application
  for your employer. See :doc:`admins`.
  
- **Software developers** -- Consider whether Lino is the right tool
  for one of your projects. See :doc:`developers`.

Companies:

- **IT solution providers** -- Consider becoming a Lino
  representative.  Tell other people about Lino.  Show the
  :ref:`demos` to other people and help them analyze whether they need
  a Lino application.  Set up your own demo server.

  Your advantage is that you get free consultation for planning your
  projects.
  
- **Internet hosting providers** -- Consider becoming a :doc:`Lino
  hosting provider </hosting/about>` and contact us to get listed in
  our :doc:`directory <hosters>`.


Who is behind Lino?
===================

The work of powering the Lino community is currently being done by
`Rumma & Ko <http://www.saffre-rumma.net>`_ a small Estonian company
whose CEO is Luc Saffre, the author and maintainer of Lino. Here is
their statement about community:

We are doing our best to help the Lino community becoming a big one,
but we have no plans of becoming *ourselves* big .  If the Lino
community would get bigger than we can manage, we recommend that it
should be governed by an independent organization which does not have
any private motivation on its own.  In order to open the door for this
evolution, we created the :doc:`Lino Team <team>`.
