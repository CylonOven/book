=============
The Lino Team
=============
  
The **Lino Team** is a group of independent developers who
help making Lino better.  They have their `organization on GitHub
<https://github.com/lino-framework>`__ which owns the different
repositories that make up the Lino framework.

We maintain `a website <http://bugs.lino-framework.org>`_ with a
common list of things to do.  You can contact us by sending an email
to *team at lino-framework.org*.  We use to speak English, but
tolerate the fact that none of us is a native speaker.

**Juristic aspects** : The Lino Team is an informal group of
co-publishers. It does neither generate revenue nor does it intend to
make or distribute profits.  There is no legal agreement signed by all
its members.  Every contributor is liable for their work: if one of us
would (accidentally) publish a file with sensitive confidential data
or copyrighted content, only that particular person (or their
employer) would be liable.  We did not (yet) formulate and sign any
Contributor License Agreement as e.g. `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/>`__ does it.
