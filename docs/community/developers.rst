The Lino developers are those guys who know the Python programming
language and invest their time into making Lino better.

**Experienced** developers are especially welcome, either as voluntary
contributors or as a paid `core developer
<http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/coredev>`_.

**Beginners** are equally welcome.  They have :doc:`their own page
</team/newbies>`.  We help you to learn how to write your own Lino
application.  Your advantage is that you get a free mentorship and
increase your chances on the job market.

**Application developers** write their own independent Lino
applications and publish them using their preferred license.

**Core developers** help us to make Lino (the framework) better. They
also maintain application code of the :ref:`lino.apps`.
