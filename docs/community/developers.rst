Developers
==========

The **Lino developers** are those guys who know the Python programming
language and invest their time into Lino.

- **Experienced** developers are especially welcome, either as
  voluntary contributors or as a paid `core developer
  <http://www.saffre-rumma.net/jobs/coredev>`_.

- **Beginners** are equally welcome.  They have :doc:`their own page
  </team/newbies>`.  We help you to learn how to write your own Lino
  application.  Your advantage is that you get a free mentorship and
  increase your chances on the job market.

We can also differentiate the following motivations:

- **Core developers** help us to make Lino better.  This includes the
  core of the framework itself, the :ref:`xl` and the
  :ref:`lino.apps`.

- **Application developers** write their own independent Lino
  applications and publish them using their preferred license.
