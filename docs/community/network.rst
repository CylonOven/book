==================
A network of teams
==================

Instead of having one central organization which rules it all, we
suggest to see the Lino community as a **network of teams**. Each Lino
team is an independent juristic entity on its own.

Currently there is only one Lino team, namely `Rumma & Ko
<http://www.saffre-rumma.net/team/>`_. This team has the role of a
pioneer because part of our work is to develop and describe a guide
for future teams.

Why can't we have one central organization?  Lino is Free Software, so
it cannot be used as capital.  The copyright for this spiritual
"property" has been left to us all, the general public.  That's why
there is no interest for bigger corporations to invest into Lino and
to build a community around it.  That's why we must do this job
ourselves.  And when we say "we", then we don't mean *Rumma & Ko* but
*all those who want to use* Lino.
