A **Lino hosting provider** is a company able to set up and maintain a
web server where your Lino application will be running.  They assume
the following responsibilities:

- they care about reliability and make sure that your Lino is always
  available to respond when you need it.
  
- they care about security and protect your system against hackers
  
- they make backups of your data to make sure it doesn't get lost in
  case of a serious accident.
  
- they care about scaling. As your site will grow in terms of number
  of users and the amount of data stored, you might want to move to a
  bigger machine.
  
- they install new versions of your application when you ask them to
  do so.  Concerning this point there are different possibilities: the
  hosting provider can either engage their own :ref:`team.admin` or
  have contract with an independant one.

Note that a hosting provider is **not reponsible** for questions about
how to use or configure the software. That's is the job of an
:doc:`/team/analyst` or a :doc:`/team/lad`.
