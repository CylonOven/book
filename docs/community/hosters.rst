Lino Hosting Provider
=====================

A **Lino hosting provider** is a company able to set up and maintain a
web server running a given Lino application for a given customer.

A Lino hosting provider assumes the following responsibilities:

- they care about reliable server operation and make sure that yuour
  site is always there to respond when you need it.
  
- they protect your system against hackers
  
- they have a backup plan which makes sure that your data doesn't get
  lost in case of a serious accident.
  
- they care about performance and scaling. As your site will grow in
  terms of number of users and the amount of data stored, you might
  one day want to move to a bigger machine.
  
- they install new versions of your application when you ask them to
  do so.  Concerning this point there are different possibilities: the
  hosting provider can either engage their own :ref:`team.admin` or
  have contract with and independant :ref:`team.admin`.

Note that a hosting provider is **not reponsible** for questions about
how to use the software. This is the job of an :doc:`/team/analyst` or
a :doc:`/team/lad`.
